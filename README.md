Priority-Queue
==============

I have implemented a Priority Queue using both a linked list and a heap, both of which implemented from scratch. 
The main is set to enqueue 500+ random integers and dequeue them all, testing whether or not the Max was truly popped 
on both data structures. Then it enqueues 500+ strings using the same data structure classes and pops them all, again 
testing whether or not the Max was truly popped on both data structures.
